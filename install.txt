You may wish to enable error_reporting while installing the scripts.
To do this change error_reporting(0); to //error_reporting(0);
	
Copy the files to your webhost making sure the index.php file is in the url root directory.
	For example /home/your_account or /home/your_friends_account/your_account
Create a database in MySQL and copy the relevant data to /includes/config.php
					
IMPORTANT: 	The scripts will immediately be in an installation-ready state.
					
Open your browser to the url you placed index.php in and follow the prompts.
	For example http://www.your-domain.com/ or http://www.your-friends-domain.com/your_lets/

Simply enter your FTP information in and the script will set the proper permissions.
					
If this doesn't work for some reason use a different method.					
This is the required configuration:
		/images		777
		/logs		777
		.htaccess	777
		/logs/<Your Site Name>.log			666
		/logs/<Your Site Name>_Errors.log	666
					
Once permissions are set refresh your browser and the script should set everything else up.
					
You can them login with username:1 and password whatever you entered previously.
